<h1>Welcome to the Original Conference App</h1>

<p>This application is being created for the 2013 Original Women's Conference. Original Conference is hosted by Original Women, a ministry of Rockford First from April 18-20, 2013. Rockford First is located in Rockford, Illinois in the state-line area about an hour northwest of Chicago. Rockford First is a church that emphasizes a pursuit after God, authentic relationships, and a life of purpose. It is made up of a vibrant and growing group of individuals who want to make a difference in their communities, see God do big things, and connect with others in a meaningful way. Rockford First is more than just a friendly church, it’s a family church. </p>
